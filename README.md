# PacketLib.jl

Julia library for crafting and capturing packets, with a focus on flexibility and expressiveness. Work with a wide range of protocols, or use it to develop a new one.

**This library is still under development, and should not be used in production until verified on all platforms under a range of conditions. (~V.6) Use on platforms other than Darwin has not been conducted. **

Any contributions are welcome, but those necessary for the next release are preferable.
